## âœ¨ Features

## Feature #1 (Forgot password protection):

- After user registration, the Email Verification page is shown with a "Resend" link.  
  The user clicks "Resend" more than 3 times but does not open or confirm any of the emails.
- **User then opens the Login page and clicks "Forgot password".**
- **(Problem we solve):** The user can abuse the system by repeatedly triggering "Forgot password", spamming password reset emails.
- **(Solution):** If more than 3 verification or reset emails were sent within the last hour and none were confirmed, an error is shown to block further emails.

## Feature #2 (Login protection):

- After registration, the user is shown the Email Verification page with a "Resend" link.  
  The user clicks "Resend" more than 3 times but does not confirm any of the emails.
- **User then opens the Login page and enters the correct username and password.**
- Keycloak redirects to the Verification page and sends a new email verification email.
- **(Problem we solve):** The user can repeatedly log in to trigger email-verification emails without confirming any, leading to spam.
- **(Solution):** If the limit is reached, the Verification page shows an error and no email is sent.

## Feature #3 (Email verification page protection)

- After registration, the user is shown the Email Verification page with a "Resend" link.  
  The user clicks "Resend" more than 3 times without confirming any emails.
- **(Problem we solve):** The user can trigger excessive email-verification messages by repeatedly clicking "Resend".
- **(Solution):** If the resend limit is reached, the page shows an error and no email is sent.

# Keycloak Custom SPI Extensions

This repository contains custom [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) Service Provider Interfaces (SPI) for:
- Custom **Authenticator** for blocking sending emails after many Forgot Password clicks 
- Custom **EventListener** for counting how many times user clicked Forgot Password or Resend verification email 
- Custom **VerifyEmail** that overrides "existing VerifyEmail Required Action" for blocking sending emails after many resend clicks or many logins with unverified email

These extensions are designed to enhance the login flow and event tracking features of Keycloak.
