This repository is under active development and not yet ready for production

## âœ¨ Features

## Feature #1 (Forgot password protection):
- After user registration we show Email confirmation page with Resend link, User clicks Resend link more than 5 times, User didn't open any emails and didn't confirm his email
- **User opens Login and clicks "Forgot password"**
- (Problem that we solve): User can spam Forgot password emails by clicking Forgot password
- (Solution) We show error because we sent more than 5 (email-verification emails that weren't confirmed or password reset emails) during last hour
- (Configuration): 
  - "Reset credentials flow" copied and "LimitResendEmail Authenticator" with "Required" was inserted before "Send Resend Email"
